# Editor Overview

The Flux editor runs inside the viewer server. It provides guided transforms and live previews.

## Highlights

- Outline and diagnostics powered by `@flux-lang/core`.
- Guided transforms for adding sections, figures, and slots.
- Live preview that mirrors the viewer runtime.

> TODO: Add screenshots and full walkthrough once the editor docs are ready.
